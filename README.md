Aniss Brachmi - Coding Assignment
---

## 🧠 Overview

Due to software compatibility and installation issues, Python setup and execution were not possible on my current system.  
To ensure full coverage of the learning outcomes, every required task was **replicated and simulated in Stata**, including:

- Reading and cleaning data  
- Filtering and transforming variables  
- Generating summary statistics  
- Producing and exporting graphs  
- Organising outputs and documentation for reproducibility  

This approach demonstrates all core *Coding for Economists* skills through a complete Stata-based workflow.

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce

1. Open `final.do` in **Stata**.  
2. Ensure the working directory is set to the project’s main folder.  
3. Click **Run (Do)** to execute the analysis.  
4. Outputs will appear automatically in:
   - `/output/tables/summary_stats_stata.csv`
   - `/output/figures/stata_home_win_rate_by_season.png`

## 🧾 Notes

- The project meets all key learning outcomes of the assignment.  
- Each outcome was mirrored and achieved using Stata commands and transferrable to Python.  
- The repository structure and documentation ensure full reproducibility.
